# elementFromEnd

=> This project contains a source file and a test file
 
=> In the source file, the class ElementFromEnd contains a Polymorphic method called 'getElementKFromEnd', which wil take two arguments - List and index 

=> I have used following formula for getting the element from the end of the list 
    
    let's say, the list is -> List(3,2,5,10), which size is 5 and index = 2
    so, the formula would be -> (size of list - index ) which will be equals to 3, it means 3rd element from the start == 2nd element from the end.
    
    In the output we will get 5.
